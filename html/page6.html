        <h1>I am Tanjiro</h1>
        <p>🌟 Tanjiro Kamado – The Gentle Warrior
Tanjiro is the main hero of Demon Slayer — and honestly, he’s not your typical shonen boy. He’s kind, respectful, super polite… and will still slice a demon’s head clean off if you mess with innocent people or his sister. 😤💢

🔥 His Backstory:
Tanjiro was living peacefully with his family, selling charcoal.

One day, he returns home to find them slaughtered by a demon, and his sister Nezuko turned into a demon.

From that moment, he decides to become a Demon Slayer to protect others and find a way to turn Nezuko human again. 💔🩸

🌊 His Abilities:
Water Breathing (early on) — smooth, flowing sword moves like Water Surface Slash 💧.

Later, he learns Hinokami Kagura (Sun Breathing) — fiery and powerful, passed down from his father 🔥.

Has a super strong sense of smell, which he uses in battle to sniff out the “Opening Thread” — the perfect moment to strike 🎯.

💚 His Personality:
Gentle, empathetic, and super respectful — even to enemies 😭.

Cries easily, but never gives up.

Treats Nezuko like a queen 🐾 and protects her at all costs.

Always stands up for what’s right, even when he’s badly hurt.

🥺 Special Moments:
When he carries Nezuko on his back through snow… 💔

The epic Hinokami battle against Rui in Season 1 — tears and goosebumps everywhere 💥😭.

His sweet moments with Zenitsu and Inosuke — like an exhausted mom with two chaotic kids 🤣💛💙.</p>
